# C64 look for Mac OS X Terminal

Inspired by the fact I FUCKING LOVE C64's, and they were the reason I am where I am today.

## Installation

* Open up Terminal, then go Preferences > Profiles.
* Select "Ocean" and click on "Default" at the bottom of the list of profiles.
* Close Preferences
* Copy .profile file to your /Users/{user}/ folder
* Open new Terminal tab/window
* ???
* Profit

## TODO

Make it so I can set the default "Ocean" profile via command line.

This thread makes it almost possible, but I am lazy and I need help: http://superuser.com/questions/313400/how-to-set-a-theme-as-default-in-terminal

## Feedback

I love feedback, pull requests are better though.
